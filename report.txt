	[USE PLAIN TEXT]


============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?

	Program runs correctly given the input specifications on the document.
	Error checks arguments and prints out a usage message on failed attempts.

	Uses the ./wildfire (-pN) [size] [probability] [density] [proportion] command to run

============= PROGRAM USAGE, OPTIONS AND Extra Credit ==

If you implemented extra credit or special, describe your results here.

	Extra Credit not implemented, but the output is in COLOR!!! 



============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

	I learned about modeling these grids in C as well as searching for neighbors.
	I learned more about command line arguments and how to parse them.

What was easy about this assignment?

	The respresentation of the board was not too bad


What gave you problems or troubles?

	The neighbor algorithm was not immedietly simple but easy to figure out after some thinking.
	The command line output was quite confusing.
	The command line options were even worse.
	
What would you like the instructor to do to improve this assignment?

	A better, more concise, and clearer set of rules would have been much appreciated.  It felt like I had to
	look through so much stuff I didn't need in order to find out stuff I did, and because we were making changes
	to the assignment, a lot of it felt contradictory.  I would rewrite the whole lab clearly and chronologically
	in the order that it should be worked on because it would be a lot clearer that way.  Most time was spent
	trying to understand the instructions.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	I would have liked to have colored output be required, since it's pretty easy, or at least have it be some
	tiny amount of extra credit.  I would have also liked to see a bunch of different features to choose from
	where students have to choose 2 or 3 to implement (like thw ind speed, maybe setting burn time as a command line option,
	etc...).
